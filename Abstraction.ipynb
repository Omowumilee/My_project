    "# Abstraction\n",
    "# Abstraction is a fundamental concept in computer science and programming that involves simplifying complex systems by \n",
    "# focusing on the essential features and ignoring unnecessary details. In Python, abstraction can be achieved through various\n",
    "# mechanisms such as functions, classes, and modules. \n",
    "# Examples:\n",
    "# 1. Abstraction using Functions:\n",
    "# Functions allow you to encapsulate a set of instructions into a single unit. This helps in hiding the implementation \n",
    "# details and exposing only the necessary functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def calculate_average(numbers):\n",
    "    total = sum(numbers)\n",
    "    count = len(numbers)\n",
    "    average = total / count\n",
    "    return average\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "result = calculate_average(numbers)\n",
    "print(f\"Average: {result}\")\n",

    "# In this example, the calculate_average function abstracts away the details of summing the numbers and calculating the\n",
    "# average. Users of the function only need to know its input and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Abstraction using Classes:\n",
    "# Classes provide a way to model and represent real-world entities with attributes and methods. They encapsulate data and \n",
